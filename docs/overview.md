# Web Scraping Overview

## Introduction

Web scraping is the automated process of extracting information from websites. It involves making HTTP requests to web servers, downloading HTML content, and parsing that content to extract specific data elements. Web scraping allows developers to transform unstructured web data into structured formats that can be stored, analyzed, and used in various applications.

Web scraping has revolutionized data collection strategies across industries by enabling access to vast amounts of publicly available information that would be impractical to gather manually. From startups to enterprise corporations, organizations leverage web scraping to inform business decisions, conduct research, and build data-driven products.

Unlike traditional data extraction methods that rely on structured APIs or database access, web scraping works with any publicly accessible web content, regardless of whether the site owner has provided a formal data access mechanism. This flexibility makes web scraping particularly valuable when working with legacy systems, unstructured content, or websites without API offerings.

## Historical Context

The practice of web scraping has evolved alongside the web itself:

- **Early 1990s**: Basic screen scrapers extracted text from simple HTML pages
- **Late 1990s**: The introduction of DOM and XML enabled more structured extraction
- **2000s**: Rise of specialized scraping libraries and commercial services
- **2010s**: Headless browsers and automation tools developed to handle JavaScript-heavy sites
- **2020s**: Machine learning integration for intelligent extraction and anti-detection methods

## How Web Scraping Works

The web scraping process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Sending HTTP Requests**: Making requests to web servers to retrieve HTML pages
    - GET/POST requests with appropriate headers
    - Session management for authentication when required
    - Managing cookies and tokens for stateful interactions

2. **Downloading Content**: Receiving and storing the HTML response
    - Response handling and status code verification
    - Content encoding and compression handling
    - Resource management for images, CSS, and other assets when needed

3. **Parsing HTML**: Using parsers to navigate the document structure
    - DOM tree construction and traversal
    - HTML normalization to handle malformed markup
    - Tag and attribute identification

4. **Data Extraction**: Selecting and extracting specific elements using selectors
    - CSS selectors for element targeting
    - XPath queries for complex navigation
    - Text normalization and encoding management

5. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming the extracted data
    - String manipulation and text normalization
    - Data type conversion and validation
    - Structured data extraction (dates, prices, measurements)
    - Entity recognition and standardization

6. **Data Storage**: Saving the structured data to a file or database
    - Format selection (CSV, JSON, XML, database records)
    - Schema design and data modeling
    - Incremental updates and versioning
    - Data deduplication and conflict resolution

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Ensuring continued operation

  - Pseudo-classes: `:first-child`, `:nth-of-type(n)`, `:not(selector)`

- **XPath**: Query specific nodes in the HTML document
  - Absolute paths: `/html/body/div`
  - Relative paths: `//div[@class='content']`
  - Attribute access: `//a[@href]`
  - Text matching: `//p[contains(text(), 'keyword')]`
  - Position selection: `//ul/li[position() < 3]`
  - Logical operators: `//div[@class='product' and @data-category='electronics']`

- **Regular Expressions**: Pattern matching for simple text extraction
  - Basic patterns: email, phone number, date extraction
  - Capture groups for structured data extraction
