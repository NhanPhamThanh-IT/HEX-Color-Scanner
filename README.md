pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Method 2: Using pip (if published)
```bash
pip install hex-color-scanner
```

### System Requirements
- **Minimum**: 2GB RAM, 1GHz CPU
- **Recommended**: 4GB RAM, 2GHz multi-core CPU for faster processing of high-resolution images

## üíª Usage

### Starting the Application
1. Navigate to the project directory and start the application:
```bash
# If using virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS

# Launch the app
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Your default web browser will automatically open with the application running at http://localhost:8501

### Using the Interface
1. **Upload an Image**:
   - Click the "Upload image" button
   - Select any PNG, JPG, or JPEG file from your device
   - The image will display on screen after successful upload

2. **Configure Settings**:
   - Use the sidebar slider to adjust the number of colors to extract (1-50)
   - More colors will capture subtle variations, fewer will focus on dominant tones

3. **Analyze Results**:
   - View the extracted colors displayed in a responsive grid layout
   - Each color is shown as a visual swatch with its corresponding HEX code

4. **Copy Colors**:
   - Click the "Copy" button under any color to copy its HEX code to clipboard
   - A toast notification will confirm successful copying
   - Use copied codes in design software, CSS, or any other application

### Tips for Best Results
- For brand analysis, upload logo images on white backgrounds
- For website color schemes, use screenshots of the homepage
- For nature-inspired palettes, try landscape photography
- Experiment with different extraction numbers to find the optimal palette size

### Component Details

#### app.py
The main application file that orchestrates the Streamlit interface, handles user inputs, and displays results. It implements:
- File upload system
- User interface components
- Visualization of extracted colors
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Error handling and user feedback

#### utils/color_extractor.py
Specializes in color data manipulation:
- Converts RGB tuples to HEX format
- Ensures color uniqueness in results
- Formats color codes for display
- Manages color data structures

#### utils/image_handler.py
Handles all image-related operations:
- Loads and validates image files
- Extracts pixel data from images
- Implements K-Means clustering for color grouping
- Identifies dominant color patterns
- Optimizes performance for large images

## üî¨ How It Works

### Technical Process Flow
1. **Image Upload & Processing**:
   - User uploads an image through the Streamlit interface
   - `ImageHandler` class loads and converts the image to RGB format
   - Pixel data is extracted and prepared for analysis

2. **Color Analysis & Clustering**:
   - K-Means clustering algorithm (from scikit-learn) analyzes pixel data
   - Similar colors are grouped together into specified number of clusters
   - Cluster centers represent the dominant colors in the image
   - Colors are sorted by frequency/dominance in the image

3. **Color Conversion & Presentation**:
   - `ColorExtractor` class converts RGB values to standardized HEX format
   - Duplicate colors are removed to ensure a unique palette
   - Colors are displayed in a responsive grid layout with visual swatches
   - Each color is paired with its HEX code and a copy button

4. **User Interaction**:
   - User can adjust settings via sidebar controls
   - Copy functionality utilizes pyperclip for cross-platform clipboard access
   - Toast notifications provide feedback on successful actions

### Algorithm Details
The K-Means clustering implementation uses these parameters:
- **n_clusters**: User-defined (1-50), determines palette size
- **random_state**: Set to 42 for reproducible results
- **Initialization**: Uses k-means++ for optimal starting cluster centers
- **Convergence**: Iterates until cluster assignments stabilize

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **Image Size**: Larger images (>4000px) may require more processing time
- **Color Count**: Requesting large numbers of colors (>30) increases computation time
- **Memory Usage**: High-resolution images with many colors may use significant memory
- **Optimization**: Internal sampling techniques maintain performance even with large images
