# <div align="center">Data Crawling Mini Project</div>

## Introduction

This project focuses on collecting data from various websites using Python. The main goal is to build an efficient, scalable, and easy-to-use data crawling tool for research or real-world applications. The project is designed to handle different types of web structures, enabling users to extract relevant data in a structured format. It provides flexibility to configure crawling parameters, support for handling dynamic content, and efficient data storage options.

## Features

- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily define rules for extracting data from various sources.
- **Scalability**: Supports parallel crawling to optimize data collection speed.
- **Handling Dynamic Content**: Uses Selenium or other headless browsers to extract JavaScript-rendered data.
- **Data Storage Options**: Store crawled data in JSON, CSV, or database systems like PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Implements robust exception handling and logs crawling progress.
- **Scheduler Support**: Enables periodic crawling using schedulers like Cron or Celery.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Directory containing the project's main source code.
- **docs/**: Directory containing related documentation.
- **tutorials/**: Directory containing guides and example use cases.
- **configs/**: Configuration files for defining crawling rules and settings.
- **logs/**: Logs generated during the crawling process.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone** the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NhanPhamThanh-IT/Data-Crawling-Mini-Project.git
   cd Data-Crawling-Mini-Project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Define crawling rules**: Modify the configuration files in the `configs/` directory to specify target websites, request headers, and extraction rules.
2. **Run the crawler**:

   ```bash
   python src/crawler.py --config configs/sample_config.json
   ```

3. **View logs**: Check the logs directory for status updates and debugging information.
4. **Process and analyze data**: Export the collected data for further processing or integrate it with analytics tools.

Detailed instructions on using the data crawling tool can be found in the `tutorials/` directory. These guides provide specific examples of how to configure and run the tool to collect data from various sources.
